## Edward Eng's GPS 1.1 Reflection File ##

What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?

* I didn't understand git add and git commit as well as I do now.

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

* I feel I have a much better understanding of the git and github workflows now.

What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

* I can't remember any specific questions at this point.

What still confuses you about Git?

* It seems like we start a lot of work from github now. So, is git init even really that useful anymore?

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

* It wasn't too bad. I felt like it took us a while to finish it since we we're a bit confused about git fetch and git merge, but we eventually figured it out. Overall, it was a good experience.
